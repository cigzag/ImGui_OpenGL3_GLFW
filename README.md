# ImGui_OpenGL3_GLFW
Example implentation of ImGui OpenGL3 GLFW for Linux with CMake.

This is a C++ code example for a standalone application using Dear ImGui, GLFW, and OpenGL 3 to create a simple UI window.

Dear ImGui is a popular library for creating graphical user interfaces in C++. GLFW is a cross-platform library for creating windows, receiving input, and handling context creation for graphics libraries such as OpenGL, Vulkan, and Metal. OpenGL is a graphics library for creating 3D graphics.

This example sets up a window with a specified size and title, initializes Dear ImGui and its backends for GLFW and OpenGL, and sets up keyboard and gamepad controls. It also loads a default dark style for the UI.

The code is divided into several sections, including setting up the GLFW window and OpenGL context, setting up the Dear ImGui context and style, setting up the backends for Dear ImGui, and loading fonts.

This example code can be a good starting point for beginners who are looking to learn how to use Dear ImGui, GLFW, and OpenGL to create UI applications in C++.
